## üöÄ Features

### Model Analysis
Gain deep insights into your Diffusion and CLIP models:

* **‚ö°Ô∏è Plot Model L2 Norms**: Visualize the L2 norms of weights across different blocks of your UNet models (SD1.5 & SDXL). Compare how primary models differ from comparison models or baselines, with options for linear, logarithmic, or **normalized difference (%)** scales.
* **‚ö°Ô∏è Plot Model Cosine Similarity**: Quantify the structural similarity between two UNet models by plotting the cosine similarity of their block-wise weights.
* **‚ö°Ô∏è Plot CLIP L2 Norms**: Analyze the L2 norms of weights within the CLIP text encoders (CLIP-L, CLIP-G).
* **‚ö°Ô∏è Plot CLIP Cosine Similarity**: Measure the cosine similarity between two CLIP models at a block level.

### Model Merging
Unlock new possibilities for combining models with sophisticated merging strategies:

* **‚ö°Ô∏è SDXL Merge Weighted Blocks**: Perform block-wise merging of SDXL models with configurable weights for each input, middle, and output block.
* **‚ö°Ô∏è SDXL Model Weight Config**: A dedicated node to easily set up and visualize the weight configurations for `SDXL Merge Weighted Blocks`.
* **‚ö°Ô∏è SDXL Karcher Merge**: Harness the power of Karcher flow for geodesic interpolation of multiple SDXL models, potentially leading to smoother and more coherent merges.
